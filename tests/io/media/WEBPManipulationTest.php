/**
 * This tests Spitfire's ability to handle WEBP files, which are an image format
 * developed by Google to reduce the bandwidth and storage requirements of images
 * while maintaining a good level of detail.
 * 
 * As of April 2020, the format has about 80% adoption across all browsers (source:
 * https://caniuse.com/#search=webp) and has received mainline support from the 
 * PHP core. Which makes it easy to deploy into existing environments.
