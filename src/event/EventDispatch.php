	/**
	 * Dispatches an event. Depending on the type of event we will have two different
	 * behaviors:
	 *
	 * 1. Observers - The listeners will only perform side effects.
	 * 2. Mutators  = The listeners can affect the output and are therefore usually mutually exclusive.
	 *
	 * Examples for observers are events that perform tasks like notifying the user
	 * of a new message via email, which does not stop the system from notifying the
	 * user (for example) via SMS.
	 *
	 * A mutating event will be an event where the target application expects a single
	 * outcome. For example, if the system has a hook to print the url of the homepage
	 * to the buffer.
	 *
	 * Usually, the application will invoke it like this:
	 * <code>&lt;?= $this->event->dispatch('myapp.output.url.homepage', function () { return url(); }); </code>
	 *
	 * The listener for our custom homepage link may look something like this:
	 * <code>
	 * spitfire()->getApplication('forum')->event->hook('myapp.output.url.homepage',
	 *   new Listener(function (Event$event) {
	 *     $event->preventDefault();
	 *     return 'https://mywebsite.com';
	 *   }
	 * );
	 * </code>
	 *
	 * Please note that mutators inherently compete for the output / return of the function,
	 * this means that they should only be used carefully and without adding many listeners
	 * to them since their behavior will become less predictable.
	 *
	 * Also, you can use this system to create complicated mutators by making use
	 * of closures, etc, but 90% of the mutators are really simple output  managing
	 * functions, so that's what we're using here.
	 *
	 * Please note: The exact specification of how a payload for an event is handled
	 * really depends on the vendor of the event, please refer to their documentation
	 * for specifics.
	 *

	 * @param Closure|null $continue
