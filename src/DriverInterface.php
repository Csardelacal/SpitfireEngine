 * The driver should allow the application to perform the following operations:
 *
 * - Query data from the database (using a query object)
 * - Insert data into the database
 * - Update data in the database
 * - Make changes to the schema (by injecting migration objects)
 *
 * We should understand the driver as an API endpoint to the interface of an abstract
 * DBMS that provides select, insert, update and alter type SQL statements (or compatible)
 * which introduces the abstraction from the specific database engine in the backend.
 *
 * This means that the application becomes completely database agnostic.
 *
 * This abstraction incurs the cost of rigidity. Since we only address features that
 * are very common among all database engines, we do not have all the features available
 * to us. Making specialized features harder to implement.
