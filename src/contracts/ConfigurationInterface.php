/**
 * Configuration contains an array of data parsed from a configuration file (or
 * multiple, in the event of the configuration referring to a directory that contains
 * configuration files).
 *
 * Due to the fact that configuration is cached, the system generates configuration
 * by invoking a static method that will recursively walk over all the files and
 * import the data, assembling a tree of arrays.
 *
 * When caching the configuration, the loaded environments are also cached and
 * therefore your application's cache will need to be rebuilt in order to load
 * new environments.
 *
 * Configuration files are automatically flattened, so that information can be
 * read with dot notation easily.
 *
 * NOTE: Configuration does not support arrays (this is why they are flattened). I seem
 * to get tripped up by this concept myself a lot, and this is why I'm adding this
 * note. If you need to configure something in an array style fashion you're probably
 * better off using service providers.
