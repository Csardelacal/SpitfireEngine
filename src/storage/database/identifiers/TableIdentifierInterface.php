/**
 * The query table wraps a table and provides a consistent aliasing mechanism.
 * This allows the system to reference tables within the database system across
 * queries.
 *
 * For example, when performing a query that requires a table to be joined twice,
 * the application needs to consistently alias the fields in the query. In SQL
 * we usually write something like
 *
 * SELECT * FROM orders LEFT JOIN customers c1 ON (...) LEFT JOIN customers c2 ON (...)
 *
 * And then reference the fields within them as c1.id or c2.id. Otherwise, the DBMS
 * will fail, indicating that the field `id` is ambiguous.
