 * A quoter allows a database grammar to properly escape data that it is being
 * made part of a SQL Query, preventing malicious users from executing any
 * SQL injection attacks.
 *
 * The strongest use case for this is testing. Some DBMS require an existing
 * connection with the DBMS to quote input, which is safer, but also requires
 * the server to be running the affected DBMS.
 *
 * By using this class we can test the grammar without the need for a DBMS to
 * be available at all.
