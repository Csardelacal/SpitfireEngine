/**
 * The dot notation accessor allows applications to access nested arrays by using a
 * simple string with dots for separators. It also provides the ability to access
 * the data without having to check intermediate steps
 *
 * In Spitfire this is mostly used in the configuration. This provides us with a
 * good mechanism to access configuration like this:
 *
 * config('vendor.com.magic3w.example', 'example);
 *
 * While using a pure array would lead to something like this:
 *
 * config()['vendor']['com']['magic3w']['example']?? 'example';
 *
 * If we wanted to make sure that all the arrays in the path are defined, we would
 * have to check whether each of them isset before accessing the data, which would
 * lead to several lines of code just to read the variable.
