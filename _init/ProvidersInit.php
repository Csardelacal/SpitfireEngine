/**
 * The init script of any servive provider allows it to use the components
 * that it registered (and potentially the ones other components registered)
 * to make the component work.
 * 
 * Here it's recommended that your component publishes resources it may need,
 * initialize storage, or data so the main application can work.
 * 
 * Please note that the order in which the register calls are invoked is not
 * guaranteed. Checking that the components you need are properly intialized
 * is very recommended.
 * 
 * If your component depends on a component that is not yet intialized you can
 * manually do so, please make sure that the component is capable of handling
 * being invoked multiple times.
