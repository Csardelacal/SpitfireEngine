 * A failure exception is a standard exception that is thrown when the application
 * wishes to report a failure to the user. This is a very generic type, and should
 * whenever possible be replaced by more specific issues that allow the application
 * to attempt to resolve the issue or give further details to the end-user.
 * 
 * Spitfire will then use an error page that is appropriate for the issue that
 * was raised. This is selected by the exception code. So a failure with a 500
 * error code will show a system error, while a failure with a 404 code should
 * present the user with a dialog that informs them that the resource can't be
 * located.
