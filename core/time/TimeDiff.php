/**
 * The time difference object is the result of calculating the relative time between
 * two timestamps. This is not intended to provide an accurate result, but instead
 * is used to generate end user representation of a time difference.
 * 
 * We used to generate a string like '30 seconds ago'. But over time we realized 
 * that this reduced the flexibility in a serious manner when working with applications
 * that would rathe (for example) display a shorter version of the string.
 * 
 * This also allows applications to programmatically analyze the result, for example,
 * an application that for posts older than a year whishes to present the date, we 
 * could do something like:
 * 
 * <code>
 * $diff = Time::relative($time);
 * echo $diff->unit() == Time::YEAR? date('m/d/Y', $time) : $diff;
 * </code>
