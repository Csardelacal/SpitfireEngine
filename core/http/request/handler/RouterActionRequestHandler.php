/**
 * The router action handler allows the application to map a route to an action
 * within a controller. This generates a request handler that will use the route
 * to extract parameters and appropriately invoke the action.
 * 
 * For example, when building a route, the application is unable to determine how
 * the route's parameters will be resolved. The route /user/{id} will be mapped to
 * the UserController::retrieve action that receives the id as a parameter.
 * 
 * This means that for a request to /user/1 the route is created without knowledge
 * of the requested url, but the router must return a request handler capable of 
 * handling the URL /user/1
 * 
 * This leaves two options, returning a request handler that is able to reuse the route
 * to retrieve the parameters it needs, or creating a single use request handler that
 * ignores the request it receives. We're choosing the first approach for this.
