/**
 * The event dispatcher acts as the central hub where event listeners are hosted
 * and where events are sent. The event dispatcher can be used in two notable ways:
 * 
 * * Writing global listeners with the global event() function
 * * Writing scoped listeners by instantiating it within the class you need to provide extensions too
 * 
 * Our first way is more convenient when handling global plugins that modify the
 * behavior of an application generically.
 * 
 * The second allows to target certain components of our application explicitly
 * while reducing the risk of collissions.
