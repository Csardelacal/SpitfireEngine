/**
 * The virtual drive class. This class is the "entry point" to any storage interface
 * and access the data within the driver.
 * 
 * Drives can be registered with the dispatcher to allow applications to retrieve
 * data from locations they have programmed in. For example, if you use an external
 * storage provider like s3, you could register s3:// as a scheme to store your 
 * data to and point the directory.uploads environment variable to your S3 server.
 * 
 * The data will be stored and you'll receive a URI like s3://xxxx/yyyy/zzzz that
 * points you to the file.
 * 
 * If, in the future you wished to start storing your data somewhere else, you can 
 * just point the directory.uploads variable somewhere else completely.
 * 
 * This is somewhat based on the way other "Virtual drive" libraries work, except 
 * that it focuses on providing text based URIs for convenient storage, which
 * allow your app to work with the data with absolute transparency.
