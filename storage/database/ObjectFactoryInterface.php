 * The database object factory is a class that allows a driver to provide SF's

 * to provide it's own Table, Query, Field... objects that implement / extend
 * the behavior required for the ORM to work.
 * 
 * Historically, a query would provide only the pieces it needed, as well as the
 * table would. But for consistency, and to avoid generating classes that only 
 * need to extend in order to provide factories we're merging those behaviors
